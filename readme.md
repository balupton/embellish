# Embellish

LOW FRICTION WEBSITE GENERATION


## What is Embellish

`embellish` builds a working static website from a bunch of text files, with optional HTML templates. It is designed to work with static websites in many forms, even in an existing directory. 


## Quick & Dirty Websites

Other generators dictate your directories to be structured their way. Embellish does not. Go to the `embellish` directory and type:

    > embellish -m .

Boom! 

`readme.html` is generated and opened in a browser. Now edit readme.txt, save, and refresh the browser.


## Installation

To install:

    pip install embellish

Python depencencies should be automatically installed. 

But if you want them manually, they are: markdown, pyyaml, python-dateutil, jinja2, hamlpy, jinja2_hamlpy, flask, sassin
